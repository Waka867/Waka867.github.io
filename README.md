Hello! Thank you for playing my take on the classic Frogger style game, built with Javascript.

When going to the game you'll first notice an alert that will come up and explain the object of the game. If for some reason this alert does not come up, please make sure Javascript is enabled in your browser settings. The game will not function at all if Javascript has been disabled. For your reference, the instructional prompt reads:

"Reach the water by pressing the directional keys to avoid the bugs. Once you get to the water you'll be awarded a point. Watch out! If you get hit by a bug you will lose a point! Audio controls are at the bottom of the page."

Once you have finished, click OK to begin the game. Your goal is to reach ten points, and once you do, you can see how many points you can get! Game background audio is designed to automatically start once you begin the game, however background audio controls are provided at the bottom of the screen. With these controls you can pause, play, mute and adjust the volume of the background audio.
